##  About Me

I'm Tarun, and I like solving problems and building useful(?) tools. My main focus right now is on Machine Learning, but I've also worked on projects involving Web Development, Data Science, and App Development. I enjoy collaborating, and I'm always open to learn and work on open-source projects together, so if you have an idea, or want to do something, hit me up!
